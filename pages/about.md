# About

Hi, I'm Gray! Welcome to my website.

I’m just a random person working in the IT industry to be honest--nothing much of note here. I like talking about Tech, Language Learning, Photography, and Living life as a Filipino expat in Japan.

When I’m not mindlessly scrolling through social media, you can find me at a photowalk, a language exchange event, or right beside a vending machine and drinking 100-yen coffee.
